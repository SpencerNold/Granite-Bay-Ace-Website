    Granite Bay, Lake of the Pines, Capitol, and East Sac Ace Hardware stores take website security seriously and use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to help protect our website and any information you choose to share with us. 
    This website is primarily informational and does not provide user accounts or a login feature at this time, and we do not intentionally request sensitive personal information through the site. 
    We work to reduce risk by keeping our website and supporting systems maintained, limiting access to systems where appropriate, and monitoring for suspicious activity; however, no website, system, or internet transmission can be guaranteed 100% secure. 
    If you contact us by phone or email, please avoid sending sensitive information such as passwords or full payment details. 
    If we learn of a security issue that affects this website, we will take appropriate steps to investigate, mitigate, and restore services, and we may update our practices over time to improve security.
