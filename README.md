# Bitwise Bandits — Ace Hardware Multi-Store Website Redesign

## Overview
Bitwise Bandits is redesigning and modernizing the multi-store website for Ace Hardware locations owned by our client, Greg Werner. Their <a href="https://granitebayace.com/"> current Ace Hardware website <a/> is outdated, difficult to maintain, visually inconsistent, and extremely expensive to host. Our mission is to deliver a modern, fast, clean, and cost-efficient website that provides accurate store information while reducing long term hosting burden.

## Project Synopsis
This project rebuilds Ace Hardware’s multi-location website from scratch using modern web practices. We aim to:
- Replace the expensive legacy hosting with a low-cost (sub–$150/yr) solution
- Create modular store components
- Build a visually consistent, professional front end
- Support easy expansion as store count increases
  
### 🖥️ Front End Solution
- Reorganized all existing content into separate, clearly defined pages to improve navigation and readability.​
- Implemented a responsive navigation bar for consistent access to pages across all screen sizes.​
- Added dropdown menus to display detailed information in a clean, compact format.​
- Redesigned headers and footers to create a modern, cohesive look throughout the site.​
- Added designated spaces for advertisements on the homepage, allowing them to be easily added, edited, or updated as needed.​
- Enhanced the overall user interface and visual hierarchy, aligning the website with modern web design standards and improving accessibility.

### 🛠️ Back End Solution
- Allow existing admins to control user roles and permissions more efficiently​
- Allow admins to manage advertisement​
- Storing admin related info in a database
