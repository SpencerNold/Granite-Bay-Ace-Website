# Bitwise Bandits — Ace Hardware Multi-Store Website Redesign

## Overview
Bitwise Bandits is redesigning and modernizing the multi-store website for Ace Hardware locations owned by our client, Greg Werner. The current site is outdated, difficult to maintain, visually inconsistent, and extremely expensive to host. Our mission is to deliver a modern, fast, clean, and cost-efficient website that provides accurate store information while reducing long term hosting burden.

## Project Synopsis

- Replace the expensive legacy hosting with a low-cost (sub–$150/yr) solution

- Build a visually consistent, professional front end
- Support easy expansion as store count increases
